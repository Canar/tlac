Mission Statement (Introduction)
	This book is written to "exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints." (Jude 1:3) We live in the era of identity politics. Almost all identity politics are toxic to the saints. The saints seek one identity: the identity of Christ. This book explains the identity politic of the gospel, as preached by Christ. It contrasts Christ's teaching against the identity politics of the world. "Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ." (Colossians 2:8)
	My target audience for this book is the Christian whose faith has developed through study of Scripture. Arguments I make here should be adapted as the Spirit leads to properly suit other contexts. I am concerned foremost with edifying my brothers and sisters in Christ. Evangelism requires a different focus: a focus on the beliefs of the non-Christian and how they match up with the gospel. Such a translation of worldview is outside the scope of this book. Take what is here and add the wisdom available to you as a sanctified priest of the order of Melchisedec. That will suffice should the spirit be willing.
