She was never expected to survive the trip,\nand history tells us that she died within hours of take-off.\nLaika has a different story to tell...\n\nsomeday you will remember.\nsomeday my name will catch in your throat and you will begin to miss what you never really had.\n\nyou never knew what you let go so easily. you never do.\ni see the way your eyes look past me into the hugeness that awaits. i know it matters most of all.\nthis street bound life of mine you took you think it's an even exchange for a legendary death in service to the great expansion.\nbut you don't really know anything about it. you have no idea.\nthose streets follow me where ever i go they are here in the vastness because my feet keep walking, even weightless.\nthose streets are home to my wildness beyond any lock and key that you trust for comfort against the cold dark night.\nthose streets are where the stars are dancing even now.\n\ni can see the dogstar thru the window. watching over me. calling me back beyond a place called home.\ni have a place in the world you long to escape. i never knew lack until you began to give.\ni became sacrifice to your dreams of escape from a place you never knew how to call home.\nand so you have never been welcomed. never called by name.\nof course all you see is empty streets and how to escape them.\n\nloyalty is born of necessity. you never earned it, i gave it to you; my generosity that you see as birthright, as my very nature.\ni am the generous one. and i do not mistake you for a god.\ni can see the stars thru the window like the eyes of my pack. reminding me of those propaganda streets that knew my name.\n\ndon't pity me. don't make me a symbol for your heartbroken culture. your insane need.\nafter death only life remains.\nmy howl will keep you awake as your dreams slip from memory.\n\noh the falling away, oh the great space that awaits\u2026i am known only by what i can do for them\u2026for you\nmy only name is progress, my only name is onwards into the impossible future.\nmy name is the death that calls us all home.\ndont pity me.\ndon't call me sacrifice upon an altar of titanium and rust.\ni live beyond what you know of me, i eat the world you can't even see and it sustains me all the way home.\n\nsomeday you will remember.\nsomeday my name will catch in your throat and you will begin to give a gift you never received.\"", "released_formatted": "04 Feb 2014", "identifiers": [], "videos": [{"uri": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfujKZL95yY", "title": "Bluetech - Light Years From Home", "description": "Bluetech - Light Years From Home\nAudio and Video produced by:  Bluetech\nAppears on Spacehop Chronicles Vol. 1\nhttp://www.facebook.com/iambluetech\nhttps://soundcloud.com/bluetech\nhttp://www.bluetechonline.com", "duration": 332, "embed": true}, {"uri": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-g9ABBeacg", "title": "Bluetech - Laika [Visualization]", "description": "Artist - Bluetech\nAlbum - Spacehop Chronicles Vol. 1\nGenre - Downtempo / Spacehop\nYear - 2014\n\nhttp://bluetech.bandcamp.com/album/spacehop-chronicles-vol-1\nhttp://www.bluetechonline.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/iambluetech", "duration": 415, "embed": true}, {"uri": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhr6mhMwVg0", "title": "Bluetech - Athena 13 [Music Video]", "description": "Artist - Bluetech\nAlbum - Spacehop Chronicles Pt. 1\nGenre - Downtempo / Spacehop\nYear - 2014\n\nSupport this awesome artist: \n\nhttp://bluetech.bandcamp.com/album/spacehop-chronicles-vol-1\nhttp://www.bluetechonline.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/iambluetech", "duration": 381, "embed": true}, {"uri": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9POUn2VTf0", "title": "Bluetech - Fold And Arrive", "description": "Bluetech - Fold And Arrive\nAlbum - Spacehop Chronicles Vol. 1 (2014)\nBluetech - http://www.bluetechonline.com/\nBluetech - https://soundcloud.com/bluetech\nBluetech - https://www.youtube.com/user/BluetechOfficial\nBluetech - http://www.facebook.com/evanmarcm", "duration": 352, "embed": true}], "genres": ["Electronic"], "styles": ["Ambient", "Downtempo", "IDM"], "tracklist": [{"position": "1", "type_": "track", "title": "Laika", "duration": "6:57"}, {"position": "2", "type_": "track", "title": "Fold And Arrive", "duration": "6:03"}, {"position": "3", "type_": "track", "title": "Athena 13", "duration": "6:23"}, {"position": "4", "type_": "track", "title": "Skybox", "duration": "5:01"}, {"position": "5", "type_": "track", "title": "Light Years From Home", "duration": "5:30"}], "extraartists": [{"name": "Orlando Arocena", "anv": "", "join": "", "role": "Artwork", "tracks": "", "id": 3200557, "resource_url": "https://api.discogs.com/artists/3200557"}, {"name": "Andrew Abramavage", "anv": "", "join": "", "role": "Co-producer", "tracks": "", "id": 3675832, "resource_url": "https://api.discogs.com/artists/3675832"}, {"name": "Thomas Palumbo", "anv": "", "join": "", "role": "Co-producer", "tracks": "", "id": 3675831, "resource_url": "https://api.discogs.com/artists/3675831"}, {"name": "Shawn Hatfield", "anv": "", "join": "", "role": "Mastered By", "tracks": "", "id": 419275, "resource_url": "https://api.discogs.com/artists/419275"}, {"name": "Bluetech", "anv": "", "join": "", "role": "Producer, Engineer", "tracks": "", "id": 152835, "resource_url": "https://api.discogs.com/artists/152835"}, {"name": "Eve Bradford", "anv": "", "join": "", "role": "Words By [Laika's Words]", "tracks": "", "id": 1929047, "resource_url": "https://api.discogs.com/artists/1929047"}], "images": [{"type": "primary", "uri": "", "resource_url": "", "uri150": "", "width": 600, "height": 598}], "thumb": "", "blocked_from_sale": false}
